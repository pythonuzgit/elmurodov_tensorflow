# Deep Learning
In practical terms, deep learning is just subset of machine learning. In fact, deep laerning technically is machine learning and functions in similar way. However, its capabilities are different. 
A deep learning model is designed to continually analyze data with a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions.

Deep learning applications use a layered structure of algorithm called an artificial neural network. The design of an artificial neural network is inspired by the boilogical of the human train, leading to a process of learning that's far more capable that of standard machine learning models.
