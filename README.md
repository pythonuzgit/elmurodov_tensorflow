# TensorFlow
In practical terms, deep learning is just subset of machine learning. In fact, deep laerning technically is machine learning and functions in similar way. However, its capabilities are different. 
A deep learning model is designed to continually analyze data with a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions.

Deep learning applications use a layered structure of algorithm called an artificial neural network. The design of an artificial neural network is inspired by the boilogical of the human train, leading to a process of learning that's far more capable that of standard machine learning models.
